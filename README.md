# twillnottweet
For tweets that won't.

Way... way back in spring 2009, when my technical proficiency was limited to standards-compliant XHTML1 and CSS2, I had my very first idea for a web-based app which would work on a mobile phone browser.

I knew that, written properly, it would require javascript to count characters. But I knew no javascript. So instead, I thought I could use a monospaced font. Only... there were about six other things it needed to do which also required javascript, for which a monospaced font would be an entirely useless solution.

So I did the only thing I could... I didn't write the first mobile phone web-app I thought of.

Anyway, 7 years later - after learning:

 - HTML5 from 2010
 - CSS3 from 2011
 - PHP server-side scripting from 2012
 - Javascript front-end scripting from 2013
 - Regex from 2014
 - SVG from 2015
 
I think I can write the damn thing now.

I still have no idea what to call it.

That said, I am familar with the convention of calling twitter-related apps something beginning with "tw...".

So I might as well call it...

**TwillNotTweet**.
